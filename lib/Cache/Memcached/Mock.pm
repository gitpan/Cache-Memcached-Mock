=head1 NAME

Cache::Memcached::Mock - A mock class for Cache::Memcached

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Supports only a subset of L<Cache::Memcached> functionality.

    # Any arguments are just ignored
    my $cache = Cache::Memcached::Mock->new();

    # Values are stored in a process global hash
    my $value = $cache->get('somekey');
    my $set_ok = $cache->set('someotherkey', 'somevalue');
    $set_ok = $cache->set('someotherkey', 'somevalue', 60);  # seconds

    # new() also flushes all values
    $cache->flush_all();

    my @values = $cache->get_multi('key1', 'key2', '...');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class can be used to mock the real L<Cache::Memcached> object when you don't have
a memcached server running (and you don't want to run one actually), but you need
the functionality to be there.

I used it in unit tests, where I had to perform several tests against a given
memcached instance, to see that certain values were really created or deleted.

Instead of having a memcached instance running for every server where I need
unit tests running, or using a centralized memcached daemon, I can just pass
a L<Cache::Memcached::Mock> instance wherever a L<Cache::Memcached> one is required.

This is an example of how you would use this mock class:

    # Use the "Mock" one instead of C::MC
    my $memc = Cache::Memcached::Mock->new();

    my $business_object = My::Business->new({
        memcached_instance => $memc
    });

    $business_object->do_something_that_involves_caching();

In short, this allows you to avoid setting up a real memcached instance
whenever you don't necessarily need one, for example unit testing.

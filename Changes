    Changes - List of significant changes to Cache::Memcached::Mock

  Changes in Cache::Memcached::Mock 0.06           27th July 2010

      Implemented emulation of the fixed-width integer arithmetic
        (truncate and overflow) when incrementing/decrementing.

      Fixed the increment/decrement functions to not define the
        key implicitly and to work correctly when using 0 (zero)
        as the delta value.

  Changes in Cache::Memcached::Mock 0.05           10th July 2010

      Fixed code to run under perl 5.8.x. Was using '//='.
      Documented the 'size_limit' artificial option.

  Changes in Cache::Memcached::Mock 0.04           08th July 2010

      Added a $VERSION, so we can express prerequisite relations.

  Changes in Cache::Memcached::Mock 0.03           08th July 2010

      Fixed fetching of multiple keys to conform to the interface.

      Fixed storage of reference values bigger in size than the
        (artificial) limit.

  Changes in Cache::Memcached::Mock 0.02           07th July 2010

      Added new methods: add(), replace(), incr(), decr(),
        set_servers(), set_compress_threshold() and related
        test cases.

      Added mimicking of default size limit for values, through
        a new tunable 'size_limit' constructor option.
